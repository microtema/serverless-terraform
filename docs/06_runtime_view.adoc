== Runtime View

The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the system’s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighbouring systems?
operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
error and exception scenarios

NOTE: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their architectural relevancy.
It is not important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

=== Runtime Scenario 1

insert runtime diagram or textual description of the scenario

insert description of the notable aspects of the interactions between the building block instances depicted in this diagram.

=== Runtime Scenario 2

…

=== Runtime Scenario n
