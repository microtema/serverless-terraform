== Building Block View

The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, …) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, …)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation. In analogy to a house this is the floor plan.

=== Level 1

is the white box description of the overall system together with black box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

=== Level 2

zooms into some building blocks of level 1. Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

=== Level 3

(not shown in the diagram above) zooms into details of selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.
