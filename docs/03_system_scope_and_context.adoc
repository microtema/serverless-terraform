== Context and Scope

System scope and context - as the name suggests - delimits your system (i.e. your scope) from all its communication partners (neighboring systems and users, i.e. the context of your system).
It thereby specifies the external interfaces.
If necessary, differentiate the business context (domain specific inputs and outputs) from the technical context ( channels, protocols, hardware).

=== Business context

Specification of all communication partners (users, IT-systems, â€¦) with explanations of domain specific inputs and outputs or interfaces. Optionally you can add domain specific formats or communication protocols.

=== Technical context

Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.
