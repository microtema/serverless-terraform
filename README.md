# Serverless Applications with AWS Lambda and API Gateway

Serverless computing is a cloud computing model in which a cloud provider allocates compute resources on demand. This contrasts with traditional cloud computing where the user is responsible for directly managing virtual servers.

Most serverless applications use Functions as a Service (FaaS) to provide application logic, along with specialized services for additional capabilities such as routing HTTP requests, message queuing, and data storage.

In this tutorial, you will deploy a NodeJS function to AWS Lambda, and then expose that function to the Internet using Amazon API Gateway.
